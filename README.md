### Part 1:
1. Problem Framing
2. EDA
3. Benchmark model.

### Part 2:
> Discontinued from Part 1 as I decided to follow the sample solution.
1. Performed 5 PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) Cycles.
2. Model Selection: Built and evaluated DTR, DTC, RF.
3. Interpreting DTC and RF using SHAPley.

### Documentation (part_2 pdf/docx):
1. Using SHAP, generate the interpretation for the selected model from solution part 2.
2. Select samplesâ€™ target and prediction to support your analysis and deployment plans.
3. Based on the visualizations and model interpretations generated, create a report of
less than 1000 words outlining how the model will be deployed. Discuss its
implications for decision-making and strategic planning.
